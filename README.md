# trading-cockpit-backend
Backend of the Trading Cockpit application.

## Features
The backend provides WebServices to create, read, update and delete the following business objects.

- Price Alerts
- Instruments
- Lists
- Scans

### Price Alerts
A price alert notifies the user if the price of an instrument reaches a certain threshold. 
There are two types of alerts. One alert informs you if a price is equal or higher than your defined price. The other type informs you if the price is equal of lower your defined price. 
The backend queries stock quotes cyclically to check if the defined threshold has been triggered.
If requested, an E-Mail is sent to a recipient when an alert has been triggered.

### Instruments
Instruments are tradable assets that come in different forms like stocks or ETFs. Currently instruments of type 'stock', 'etf', 'sector','industry group' and 'ratio' can be managed.

### Lists
Lists allow you to organize sets of instruments. The list feature allows you for example to reproduce ETFs or stock indexes. Lists are used by the scan functionality to scan and screen all instruments of multiple lists.

### Scans
A Scan consists of multiple lists that have instruments defined in them. The scan process queries historical price and volume data of the instruments. Indicators are then calculated and the instruments are ranked according to their performance of the past year.
The backend offers multiple templates to filter the scan results by different characteristics. For example stocks can be filtered that have advanced on above-average volume.
Ratio data are not queried from a third-party data provider. Instead they are calculated locally within the application based on existing instrument data.

### Dashboard
The Dashboard aims to provide a meta overview of the current state of the market.

At the end of the scan process, statistical data of the instruments are calculated. Those statistics are exposed either as tabular data or as charts using WebServices.

## Technology

The Trading Cockpit is based on the following technologies and frameworks

 - **Java Persistence API** and **Hibernate** for ORM (Object Relational Mapping)
 - **HSQLDB** as database
 - **Bean Validation API** for validation of model classes
 - **Jersey** for RESTful WebServices
 - **Log4J** for application logging
 - **JUnit** for test-driven development
 - **okhttp** to access third-party WebServices
 - **Apache POI** to generate Excel Sheets
 - **OpenCSV** to parse CSV files
 - **JFreeChart** to generate charts
 - **HtmlUnit** to extract price information from third-party Websites
 - **Apache Maven** as build system

## Installation

1. Build the project using the Maven run configuration "trading-cockpit-backend (clean install).launch"
2. Deploy the ".war"-file to your WebServer. The application name has to be "trading-cockpit-backend". The frontend expects the WebServices under this path.
3. Move the configuration file "tradingCockpitBackend.properties" from the "target"-folder of your build path to the "conf"-folder of your WebServer.
4. Modify the configuration file according to your needs.
